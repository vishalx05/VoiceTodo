Voice Notes to Task List
Voice Notes to Task List is a web-based to-do list application that helps users manage their tasks easily using both voice commands and manual input. It provides a hands-free way to stay productive by allowing users to speak their tasks, which are then converted into text and added to the task list automatically.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the Web Speech API available in modern browsers (like Google Chrome) for voice recognition. It is lightweight, easy to use, and works entirely on the front endâ€”no installation or backend setup needed.

Features
Add tasks using voice: Click the "Speak" button and say your task. The app will convert your speech into text and add it to the task list.
Add tasks manually: Type your task into the input box and click the "Add" button to include it in the list.
Mark tasks as completed: Click on a task to strike it through, indicating that it is done.
Delete tasks: Remove any task from the list by clicking the delete button next to it.
Clean interface: Simple, responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
